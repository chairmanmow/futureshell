BBS lovers If you've been to futureland and wondered how the shell worked, here's your chance to take a peek.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE SUPPORTED.  WHILE YOU ARE FREE TO TRY RUNNING IT AND ASKING FOR ADVICE, it is just to show you how it works for your education, and to demonstrate what can be accomplished when you dive head first.  

The formatting is representative of the fact that I was hacking through this code a lot, and hadn't picked up on conventions.  It works, and I know how it works, but it doesn't need so many lines.  Nonetheless, it stands as an accomplishment compared to others.

I may cobble away at this to make it more usuable or I might just completely re-write it.  I don't know if I'll give away the revised finished product to everyone if it gets lazy and leechy with my time.  There probably doesn't need to be so much code, and I've learned a lot of new things that I wouldn't have dare tried earlier that I can implement easily now.  

If you install this on your BBS it won't break it, but you should know how to activate another shell should you get caught in a loop you can't get out of.  You were warned.  If you don't know how to install a shell in the first place, you definitely should not start here.
