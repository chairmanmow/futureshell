BBS lovers If you've been to futureland and wondered how the shell worked, here's your chance to take a peek.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE SUPPORTED.  WHILE YOU ARE FREE TO TRY RUNNING IT AND ASKING FOR ADVICE, it is just to show you how it works for your education, and to demonstrate what can be accomplished when you dive head first.  

The formatting is representative of the fact that I was hacking through this code a lot, and hadn't picked up on conventions.  It works, and I know how it works, but it doesn't need so many lines.  Nonetheless, it stands as an accomplishment compared to others.

I may cobble away at this to make it more usuable or I might just completely re-write it.  I don't know if I'll give away the revised finished product to everyone if it gets lazy and leechy with my time.  There probably doesn't need to be so much code, and I've learned a lot of new things that I wouldn't have dare tried earlier that I can implement easily now.  

If you install this on your BBS it won't break it, but you should know how to activate another shell should you get caught in a loop you can't get out of.  You were warned.  If you don't know how to install a shell in the first place, you definitely should not start here.

Here's some things you can learn : 


how to create a tree menu (if you had to do a basic customization this would be the first place to start)
how to use frames (this would be where you can customize colors)
how to grab rss feeds and parse them and use a timer to keep them fresh (you can add your own feeds to an array)
how to make json-chat and connect to a server
how to do conditional formatting (if me show this else show that)
how to display a random ansi (loading a random file from a directory)
how to use message base objects and interact with them (that's how the bottom right frame works);
how to use other people's code and make it do what you expect it to

oh, and how to write sloppy code!  

also, portions of the functionality were reverse engineered and in some respects outright copied from examples in the CVS, but it is mainly my creation, inspired by boards mostly in the center of awareness bbs collective (google it), i'm not a member but i respect their contributions as well as the other synchronet developers with which enabled me to build something like this.
